# The current implementation saves the spec with `type.name` in the mon_store.
# This has the advantage that you can retrieve specific specs without iterating
# through all specs in order to find the requested spec of `type` foo.
# Computationally speaking this shouldn't really matter as there are never more
# than 10~ specs stored. Also, we pre-load all specs on ceph-mgr startup.
